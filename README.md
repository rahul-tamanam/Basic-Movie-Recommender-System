- Implements **Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) Vectorization** to analyze textual content and extract meaningful features.
- Recommends movies based on the closest matches in review content, ensuring personalized and relevant suggestions.

## Features

- **Machine Learning-Driven**: Employs TF-IDF vectorization to assess review similarity.
- **Efficient Matching Algorithm**: Finds the best movie recommendations quickly and accurately.

## Future Enhancements
